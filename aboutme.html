    									<h2>About Me...</h2>
    									<p class="subheading">My name is Justice Jones</p>
									</header>

									<p>
        								I grew up in Kalona, Iowa, and have spent most of my life in the Iowa City area and have always been connected to the Hawkeye community. I attended Mid-Prairie High School and come from a family of five with an older sister, a younger sister, and parents who reside in Kalona to this day. Being around the area my whole life has made me a longtime Iowa Hawkeye fan watching football, basketabll, and wrestling. I am also a fan of the Green Bay Packers but enjoy watching any football.
    								</p>

    								<p>
										I’m currently a senior at the University of Iowa majoring in Business Analytics and Marketing, 
										and I expect to graduate in May 2026. I’ve enjoyed my time in Iowa City, from living in the 
										dorms and going to tailgates to spending time in Tippie, playing intramurals, and getting to 
										know the community on and off campus. These experiences have given me a good sense of what I 
										enjoy working on and the types of environments I work well in.
									</p>

    								<p>
										Outside of academics, I like staying active and being outdoors. I spend a lot of my free time 
										lifting, playing basketball, fishing, boating, or hanging out with friends and family. I’ve 
										always liked having a balance between school, work, and the things I enjoy doing day to day.
									</p>
							
									<p>
										I'm someone who likes to solve problems, build things, and figure out how systems or ideas 
										fit together. I enjoy learning new skills and taking on challenges that give me something 
										new to think about. That interest in hands-on problem-solving is a big part of what led me 
										toward analytics and marketing, since both areas let me combine practical thinking with 
										creativity and data.
