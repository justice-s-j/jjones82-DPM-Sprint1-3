            <h2>College Experience</h2>
            <p>
                I am a senior at the University of Iowa studying Business Analytics &amp; Information Systems (BAIS) 
                and Marketing at the Tippie College of Business. My coursework has focused on data wrangling, 
                data mining, digital product management, and marketing analytics.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve worked on several hands-on projects, including building data pipelines and predictive models, 
                creating interactive dashboards, and developing a personal portfolio website as part of my 
                Digital Product Management course. These projects have helped me get comfortable working with data, 
                telling stories with it, and thinking about how real users interact with digital products.

            <h2>Work & Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>
                Outside the classroom, I’ve worked as a follow-spot operator for events at Carver-Hawkeye Arena, 
                where I’ve learned to stay focused under pressure, communicate clearly with a crew, and pay close 
                attention to timing and detail during live events.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve also been involved in projects that required coordinating with classmates, professors, and 
                professionals, which has strengthened my teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills. 
                I enjoy roles where I can combine data, technology, and practical decision-making to create 
                something useful.
